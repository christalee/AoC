# AoC
Code samples from Advent of Code puzzles. Solutions and tests for [2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) are fairly complete, including a summary of each problem; some less polished code exists for [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) (when I briefly experimented with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) & type checking) and [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) (to advise some fellow programmers).

Next steps will focus on tidying up the code as teaching/portfolio examples; improving performance; and eventually tackling unsolved problems.
