Code samples from Advent of Code puzzles. Solutions and tests for 2016 are fairly complete, including a summary of each problem; some less polished code exists for 2015 (when I was experimenting with mypy & type checking) and 2018 (to help advise some fellow programmers).

Next steps will probably focus on tidying up the code as teaching examples; improving performance; and eventually tackling unsolved problems.
